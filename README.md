# Riyal-Currency-Detection-Project
The Riyal Currency Detection project is a computer vision application designed to identify and classify Riyal banknotes. Leveraging the power of transfer learning, the project utilizes the VGG16 neural network architecture to achieve accurate and reliable currency detection.
# Key Features
Transfer Learning with VGG16: The project benefits from the transfer learning technique, employing the well-established VGG16 model as a starting point. This allows the model to leverage pre-trained weights on a large dataset, enhancing its ability to recognize and differentiate features specific to Riyal banknotes.

Data Collection and Augmentation: The dataset used for training was meticulously collected, ensuring diversity and representation of various Riyal denominations. To augment the dataset and enhance model robustness, image augmentation techniques were applied. These included random rotations, noisy, and changes in lighting conditions, resulting in a more versatile and adaptive model.
Validation Accuracy: Through rigorous training and validation, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of 82% on the validation dataset. This high level of accuracy underscores the effectiveness of the chosen approach and the model's capability to generalize well to unseen data.
Usage
The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to upload images of Riyal banknotes for automatic detection. The model processes the image and provides a classification result, indicating the denomination of the currency.
